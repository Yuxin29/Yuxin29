About
  Hi, I’m @Yuxin29
💻 I’m an architect with 5+ years of experience transitioning into software engineering, bringing a unique combination of design thinking, technical problem-solving and a strong foundation in programming.

🚀 I’ve built my coding skills in C, C++ and Python at Hive Helsinki, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and clean coding habits. I’m now diving deeper into full-stack development, learning how to build scalable, user-focused applications.

My background in architecture design and project management trained me to:
- 🧠 Approach problems systematically and creatively with clean code structure.
- 🤝 Collaborate across disciplines and communicate clearly with diverse teams and clients.
- 📐 Working in complex projects with precision and attention to detail.

As I grow as a software engineer, I’m eager to apply this mindset to real-world tech problems. I’m currently seeking a Summer Job in Software Engineering in 2026.

✨ Always building. Always learning.
