About
Hi, I’m @Yuxin29
💻 I’m an architect with 5+ years of experience transitioning into software engineering, bringing a unique combination of design thinking, technical problem-solving and a strong foundation in programming.

🚀 I’ve built my coding skills in C, C++ and Python at Hive Helsinki, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and clean coding habits. I’m now diving deeper into full-stack development, learning how to build scalable, user-focused applications.

My background in architecture design and project management trained me to:
- Approach problems systematically and creatively with clean code structure.
- Collaborate across disciplines and communicate clearly with diverse teams and clients.
- Working in complex projects with precision and attention to detail.

🌍 I have a strong interest in mapping, GIS and urban datas. My focus is on creating applications that make spatial information meaningful and interactive.

As I grow as a software engineer, I’m eager to apply this mindset to real-world tech problems. Currently I’m seeking a summer job in Software Engineering in 2026.
Reach me by email: yuxin.29.wu@gmail.c

✨ Always building. Always learning.
